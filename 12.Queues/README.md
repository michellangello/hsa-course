# Queue Service - Beanstalkd and Redis Integration

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a queue service using **Beanstalkd** and **Redis (RDB & AOF)** for efficient message queuing and processing. The service includes endpoints to **push and pull messages** concurrently.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Push & Pull APIs** for Beanstalkd, Redis RDB, and Redis AOF
- **Concurrency Handling** to prevent request freezing

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
- **Redis AOF generally outperforms Redis RDB in push and pull transactions, especially under high concurrency.**
- **Redis RDB performance degrades significantly as concurrency increases, showing high response times at 250 concurrent users.**
- **Beanstalkd has excellent push transaction speed but struggles with pull transactions under load.**
- **For high throughput, AOF is the best choice.**
- **For fast queue insertion, Beanstalkd performs well but may slow down with high pull request loads.**
- **Beanstalkd pull performance suffers because it requires two operations (`reserve` and `delete`) per retrieval, increasing overhead.**
- **Beanstalkd has limited documentation, making troubleshooting and optimizations difficult.**
- **A new connection must be created for each request in Beanstalkd, further impacting performance.**
