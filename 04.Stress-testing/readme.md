# Load Testing with Siege

## Task Overview

The objective of this task is to create a simple web page that accepts incoming HTTP requests and stores data from each request into a database. We then perform load testing using Siege to evaluate the system's performance under different levels of concurrency.

## Service Overview

The `/employee` endpoint is a POST endpoint that generates a random employee record using the Bogus library and inserts it into a MongoDB database. When a request is made, the service retrieves a database instance named employees, accesses the employees collection, and stores the generated employee data. The response returns the newly created employee record.

## Summary

-	Availability remains consistently high (â‰¥99.99%) across all tested concurrency levels.
- 	Average response time significantly increases as concurrency grows:
- 	From 16.79 ms at 10 users to 318.23 ms at 200 users.
- 	Throughput stays relatively stable (~0.15 MB/sec), indicating consistent network performance.
- 	Performance degradation at higher concurrency levels suggests potential improvements such as database indexing, caching, and enhanced scalability.
